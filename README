ircl is an IRC library for Java.

I got frustrated with the implementation of IRClib at 
http://moepii.sourceforge.net/ so I wrote my own.

My initial purpose for this library was an IRC Log4j Appender,
so you get a Log4j appender as a gratuitous bonus.

I've only implemented the IRC commands that are relevant to
the Log4j Appender thus far, so this library may be incomplete
for what you may need it for, although it is very easy to
support more commands or handle more events.
